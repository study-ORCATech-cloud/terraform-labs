# LAB02: Creating and Managing an S3 Bucket with Terraform

## üìù Lab Overview

In this lab, you'll use **Terraform** to create and manage an **Amazon S3 bucket**. You'll configure key S3 features including versioning, access policies, and optionally set up static website hosting. This lab demonstrates how infrastructure as code can simplify storage provisioning and management in AWS.

Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) is a scalable object storage service that can store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere on the web. It's commonly used for backup and storage, hosting static websites, storing application assets, data lakes, and more.

## üöÄ Lab Steps

### Step 1: Prepare Your Environment

1. Ensure AWS CLI is configured:
   ```bash
   aws configure
   # OR use environment variables:
   # export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="your_access_key"
   # export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="your_secret_key"
   # export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION="eu-west-1"
   ```

### Step 2: Initialize Terraform

1. Navigate to the lab directory:
   ```bash
   cd AWS/LAB02-S3-Bucket
   ```

2. Initialize Terraform to download provider plugins:
   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```

### Step 3: Configure Bucket Settings

1. Create a `terraform.tfvars` file by copying the example:
   ```bash
   cp terraform.tfvars.example terraform.tfvars
   ```

2. Edit the `terraform.tfvars` file to customize your deployment:
   ```bash
   # The S3 bucket name must be globally unique across all AWS accounts
   bucket_name = "your-name-terraform-lab02-bucket"
   
   # Uncomment these lines if you want to enable static website hosting
   # allow_public_access = true
   # enable_static_website = true
   ```

   > ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: S3 bucket names must be globally unique across all AWS accounts. Choose a name that is unlikely to be taken.

### Step 4: Review the Execution Plan

1. Generate and review the execution plan:
   ```bash
   terraform plan
   ```

2. Verify the resources to be created:
   - S3 bucket with your specified name
   - Versioning configuration
   - Access control settings
   - Website configuration (if enabled)

### Step 5: Create the S3 Bucket

1. Apply the Terraform configuration:
   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```

2. Type `yes` when prompted to confirm

3. After successful creation, Terraform will display outputs including:
   - Bucket name
   - Bucket ARN
   - Website URL (if enabled)

### Step 6: Explore Bucket Features

1. List the created bucket:
   ```bash
   aws s3 ls
   ```

2. If you enabled website hosting, access the website URL from the output:
   ```
   http://<bucket-name>.s3-website.<region>.amazonaws.com
   ```

3. Test uploading a file to your bucket:
   ```bash
   echo "Hello, S3!" > hello.txt
   aws s3 cp hello.txt s3://your-name-terraform-lab02-bucket/
   ```

4. List bucket contents:
   ```bash
   aws s3 ls s3://your-name-terraform-lab02-bucket/
   ```

5. Test versioning by uploading the same file again with different content:
   ```bash
   echo "Hello again, S3!" > hello.txt
   aws s3 cp hello.txt s3://your-name-terraform-lab02-bucket/
   ```

6. List object versions:
   ```bash
   aws s3api list-object-versions --bucket your-name-terraform-lab02-bucket
   ```

## üîç Understanding the Code

### Main Resources

1. **aws_s3_bucket** - Creates the basic S3 bucket:
   ```hcl
   resource "aws_s3_bucket" "lab02_bucket" {
     bucket = var.bucket_name
     tags = {
       Name        = var.bucket_name
       Environment = var.environment
     }
   }
   ```

2. **aws_s3_bucket_versioning** - Controls versioning settings:
   ```hcl
   resource "aws_s3_bucket_versioning" "lab02_bucket_versioning" {
     bucket = aws_s3_bucket.lab02_bucket.id
     versioning_configuration {
       status = var.versioning_enabled ? "Enabled" : "Suspended"
     }
   }
   ```

3. **aws_s3_bucket_website_configuration** - Configures static website hosting:
   ```hcl
   resource "aws_s3_bucket_website_configuration" "lab02_website" {
     count  = var.enable_static_website ? 1 : 0
     bucket = aws_s3_bucket.lab02_bucket.id
     index_document {
       suffix = "index.html"
     }
     error_document {
       key = "error.html"
     }
   }
   ```

4. **aws_s3_bucket_policy** - Sets permissions for public access:
   ```hcl
   resource "aws_s3_bucket_policy" "lab02_bucket_policy" {
     count  = var.enable_static_website && var.allow_public_access ? 1 : 0
     bucket = aws_s3_bucket.lab02_bucket.id
     policy = jsonencode({
       Version = "2012-10-17"
       Statement = [
         {
           Sid       = "PublicReadGetObject"
           Effect    = "Allow"
           Principal = "*"
           Action    = "s3:GetObject"
           Resource  = "${aws_s3_bucket.lab02_bucket.arn}/*"
         },
       ]
     })
   }
   ```

## üß™ Challenge Exercises

Ready to learn more? Try these extensions:

1. **Object Lifecycle Rules** - Add a lifecycle rule to transition older objects to Glacier storage
   ```hcl
   resource "aws_s3_bucket_lifecycle_configuration" "example" {
     bucket = aws_s3_bucket.lab02_bucket.id
     rule {
       id     = "archive-rule"
       status = "Enabled"
       transition {
         days          = 30
         storage_class = "GLACIER"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Server-Side Encryption** - Enable default encryption for the bucket
   ```hcl
   resource "aws_s3_bucket_server_side_encryption_configuration" "example" {
     bucket = aws_s3_bucket.lab02_bucket.id
     rule {
       apply_server_side_encryption_by_default {
         sse_algorithm = "AES256"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. **CORS Configuration** - Add a CORS configuration to allow cross-origin requests
   ```hcl
   resource "aws_s3_bucket_cors_configuration" "example" {
     bucket = aws_s3_bucket.lab02_bucket.id
     cors_rule {
       allowed_headers = ["*"]
       allowed_methods = ["GET"]
       allowed_origins = ["https://example.com"]
       max_age_seconds = 3000
     }
   }
   ```

## üßº Cleanup

To avoid ongoing charges for the resources created in this lab:

1. First, empty the bucket (required before deletion):
   ```bash
   aws s3 rm s3://your-name-terraform-lab02-bucket/ --recursive
   ```

   > ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: If versioning is enabled, you need to delete all versions of objects:
   ```bash
   aws s3api delete-objects --bucket your-name-terraform-lab02-bucket \
     --delete "$(aws s3api list-object-versions --bucket your-name-terraform-lab02-bucket \
     --output json --query '{Objects: Versions[].{Key:Key,VersionId:VersionId}}')"
   ```

2. Use Terraform to destroy all resources:
   ```bash
   terraform destroy
   ```

3. Type `yes` when prompted

4. Verify in the AWS Console that the bucket has been deleted:
   - Navigate to S3 in the AWS Console
   - Confirm that your bucket no longer exists

5. Clean up local files (optional):
   ```bash
   # Remove Terraform state files and other generated files
   rm -rf .terraform* terraform.tfstate* terraform.tfvars
   ```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Always remember to empty and delete your S3 buckets when you're done to avoid unexpected charges on your AWS account.
