# LAB01: Provisioning an EC2 Instance with Terraform

## üìù Lab Overview

In this lab, you'll use **Terraform** to provision a basic EC2 instance running a web server on AWS. You'll learn how Infrastructure as Code (IaC) can automate cloud provisioning tasks that would otherwise be performed manually in the AWS Console.

---

## üéØ Learning Objectives

- Initialize a Terraform working directory
- Configure the AWS provider
- Define and use input variables
- Create a security group for your EC2 instance
- Create and use an SSH key pair for secure access
- Deploy an EC2 instance with a web server
- Output key resource information
- Clean up resources to avoid unexpected charges

---

## üß∞ Prerequisites

- AWS account with administrator access
- AWS CLI installed and configured with access credentials
- Terraform v1.3+ installed
- SSH key pair generated on your local machine

---

## üöÄ Lab Steps

### Step 1: Prepare Your Environment

1. Ensure AWS CLI is configured:
   ```bash
   aws configure
   # OR use environment variables:
   # export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="your_access_key"
   # export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="your_secret_key"
   # export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION="eu-west-1"
   ```

2. Ensure you have an SSH key pair:
   ```bash
   # Check if you already have a key
   ls ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
   
   # If not, generate a new key pair in the lab directory
   cd AWS/LAB01-EC2-Instance
   ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -f lab01-key -N ""
   ```

### Step 2: Initialize Terraform

1. Navigate to the lab directory:
   ```bash
   cd AWS/LAB01-EC2-Instance
   ```

2. Initialize Terraform to download provider plugins:
   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```

### Step 3: Configure Variables (Optional)

1. Create a `terraform.tfvars` file by copying the example:
   ```bash
   cp terraform.tfvars.example terraform.tfvars
   ```

2. Edit the `terraform.tfvars` file to customize your deployment:
   ```bash
   # Example modifications
   aws_region    = "eu-west-1"  # Change region if needed
   instance_type = "t2.micro"   # Change instance type if desired
   key_name      = "my-key-pair" # Set your preferred key name
   ```

### Step 4: Complete the TODO Sections

This lab contains several TODO sections that you need to complete:

1. In `main.tf`:
   - Create a security group that allows SSH and HTTP traffic
   - Create a key pair for SSH access
   - Create an EC2 instance with the specified requirements

2. In `outputs.tf`:
   - Define outputs for instance ID, public IP, public DNS, security group ID, and SSH command

### Step 5: Review the Execution Plan

1. Generate and review an execution plan:
   ```bash
   terraform plan
   ```

2. Verify the resources to be created:
   - Security group with proper inbound/outbound rules
   - Key pair for SSH access
   - EC2 instance with user data script for Apache installation

### Step 6: Apply the Configuration

1. Apply the Terraform configuration:
   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```

2. Type `yes` when prompted to approve the actions

3. Wait for the infrastructure to be provisioned (typically 1-2 minutes)

### Step 7: Explore Your Deployment

1. After successful application, Terraform will output:
   - Instance ID
   - Public IP address
   - Public DNS name
   - Security group ID
   - SSH connection command

2. Access the web server by opening the public IP in a browser:
   ```
   http://<instance_public_ip>
   ```

3. Connect to your instance via SSH:
   ```bash
   # Using the output SSH command
   ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa ec2-user@<instance_public_dns>
   ```

## üîç Understanding the Code

### Provider Configuration
```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = var.aws_region
}
```
Establishes the connection to AWS in the specified region.

### Security
- **Security Group**: Acts as a virtual firewall for the instance
  - Allows inbound SSH (port 22) for remote management
  - Allows inbound HTTP (port 80) for web server access
  - Allows all outbound traffic
- **Key Pair**: Registers your public SSH key for secure access

### Computing
- **EC2 Instance**: Provisions a virtual machine with:
  - Amazon Linux 2 AMI
  - t2.micro instance type (free tier eligible)
  - 8GB root volume of gp2 type
  - User data script to install and configure Apache web server
  - Appropriate tags for resource management

---

## üí° Learning Points

- **Infrastructure as Code**: Managing infrastructure through code offers repeatability and version control
- **Resource Dependencies**: Terraform automatically handles resource creation order
- **User Data**: Bootstrapping instances at launch saves manual configuration
- **Security Groups**: Configuring network access controls for cloud resources
- **Output Values**: Retrieving deployment information streamlines usage
- **Variable Usage**: Setting sensible defaults while allowing customization

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **AWS Credentials Error**: 
   ```
   Error: No valid credential sources found
   ```
   **Solution**: Configure AWS CLI or set environment variables with your credentials.

2. **SSH Key Not Found**:
   ```
   Error: failed to read public key: open ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub: no such file or directory
   ```
   **Solution**: Generate a key pair or specify the correct path in variables.

3. **Resource Limits**:
   ```
   Error: Error launching source instance: VcpuLimitExceeded
   ```
   **Solution**: Request a service limit increase or use a different instance type.

4. **Security Group Rules**:
   ```
   Error: Error creating Security Group: InvalidParameterValue
   ```
   **Solution**: Ensure CIDR blocks and protocol specifications are correctly formatted.

## ‚úÖ Challenge Exercises

Ready for more? Try these enhancements:

1. **Add Tags**: Implement additional tags like Owner, Project, or Cost Center
2. **Modify User Data**: Update the script to install and configure a different web server (like Nginx)
3. **Create Custom VPC**: Extend the configuration to create a custom VPC instead of using the default VPC
4. **Add an Elastic IP**: Modify the configuration to associate an Elastic IP with your instance

---

## üßº Cleanup

To avoid ongoing charges for the resources created in this lab:

1. Destroy all resources:
   ```bash
   terraform destroy
   ```

2. Type `yes` when prompted

3. Verify in the AWS Console that all resources have been deleted:
   - EC2 instance terminated
   - Security groups deleted

4. Clean up local files (optional):
   ```bash
   # Remove Terraform state files and other generated files
   rm -rf .terraform* terraform.tfstate*
   ```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Always remember to destroy your resources when you're done to avoid unexpected charges on your AWS account.
