# LAB19: AWS Step Functions and State Management with Terraform

## üìù Lab Overview

In this lab, you'll use Terraform to implement **AWS Step Functions** for orchestrating complex workflows. You'll create serverless state machines that coordinate multiple AWS services, implement error handling and retry logic, and build both standard and express workflows for different use cases.

---

## üéØ Learning Objectives

- Deploy AWS Step Functions state machines using Terraform
- Design complex workflows with various state types
- Implement error handling, retry logic, and state management
- Create integrations with Lambda, SQS, DynamoDB, and other services
- Configure parallel processing and map states for bulk operations
- Implement choice-based branching and condition handling
- Set up standard and express workflows for different scenarios
- Monitor and debug Step Function executions

---

## üìã Prerequisites

- AWS account with appropriate permissions
- Terraform v1.0+ installed
- AWS CLI configured with appropriate credentials
- Basic understanding of state machines and workflows
- Familiarity with JSON for state machine definitions
- Completion of LAB10 (Lambda) recommended

---

## üî® Lab Tasks

1. **Create a Basic Step Function**:
   - Define a simple state machine with Task and Choice states
   - Configure IAM roles and policies
   - Deploy and test execution

2. **Implement Error Handling**:
   - Add Retry, Catch, and Error states
   - Configure retry policies with exponential backoff
   - Test error scenarios and recovery

3. **Create Service Integrations**:
   - Integrate with Lambda functions
   - Add DynamoDB operations
   - Configure SQS message processing
   - Implement SNS notifications

4. **Build Parallel Processing Workflow**:
   - Configure Parallel state for concurrent execution
   - Implement Map state for processing arrays
   - Handle results from parallel branches
   - Test with varying workloads

5. **Create Choice-based Routing**:
   - Implement complex Choice state with multiple conditions
   - Configure JSON path expressions for evaluation
   - Create branching logic based on input parameters
   - Test different execution paths

6. **Deploy Express Workflow**:
   - Configure high-throughput Express workflow
   - Compare with Standard workflow
   - Test performance and cost differences
   - Implement synchronous and asynchronous patterns

7. **Set up Monitoring and Logging**:
   - Configure CloudWatch Logs for execution history
   - Create CloudWatch metrics and alarms
   - Implement X-Ray tracing
   - Set up Event Bridge rules for failure notifications

8. **Implement Nested Workflows**:
   - Create parent and child state machines
   - Configure Step Functions calling other Step Functions
   - Implement workflow composition patterns
   - Test complex orchestration scenarios

## üí° Expected Outcomes

After completing this lab, you'll have:
- Multiple Step Functions state machines for different use cases
- Complex workflows orchestrating multiple AWS services
- Robust error handling and retry mechanisms
- Parallel and distributed processing capabilities
- Comprehensive monitoring and debugging setup
- Optimized workflows for different throughput needs

---

## üìö Advanced Challenges

- Implement human approval workflows
- Create distributed transaction management
- Build machine learning processing pipelines
- Implement saga pattern for distributed systems
- Create visual workflow editor using AWS SDK

---

## üßπ Cleanup

To avoid unexpected charges, make sure to destroy all resources when you're done:

```bash
terraform destroy
```

Key resources to verify deletion:
- Step Functions state machines
- Lambda functions
- IAM roles and policies
- CloudWatch logs and alarms
- DynamoDB tables
- SQS queues
- SNS topics
