# Terraform Labs: Cross-Platform Infrastructure Automation Roadmap

Welcome to the **Terraform Labs** project â€” a parallel track to the Cloud Labs UI & CLI series. These labs focus on automating cloud infrastructure using **Terraform**, the leading Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool.

This roadmap mirrors the structure of the UI/CLI labs, enabling learners to implement the same scenarios via code and understand how manual tasks can be translated into automation workflows.

## ðŸ“… Terraform Lab Roadmap

Each lab uses Terraform to provision the same cloud resources previously handled via UI and CLI. Labs are organized by provider and skill level.
